# LazyWeather-for-iOS

Thanks for your interest! Check back in a week for a finished beta release!

Lazy Weather is still in developement.

Arthur Pan and I have spent the last month learning how to work with iOS and the past week working on LazyWeather.

So far we have implemented the data fetching process and as well as the UI for the home view.

This weekend we will finish the UI for our other view and tie everything together with our background update and notification process

We plan to launch a beta by October 20, so check back then to see our working release!

If you're interested, we get our data from the Dark Sky Forecast API:
