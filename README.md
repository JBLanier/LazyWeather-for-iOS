# LazyWeather-for-iOS

Thanks for your interest! WeatherLazy is in Beta!

If you'd like to test it out yourself, send an email to johnblanier@gmail.com and I can send you an Apple Testflight invitation!

WeatherLazy Team consists of UC Santa Barbara Students John B. Lanier, and Arthur Pan (check us out under "contributors")

We spent late September and early October researching iOS and have been working on WeatherLazy since.

So far we have implemented the data fetching process and as well as the UI for the home view.

This weekend we will finish the UI for our other view and tie everything together with our background update and notification process

We plan to launch a beta by October 20, so check back then to see our working release!

If you're interested, we get our data from the Dark Sky Forecast API:
